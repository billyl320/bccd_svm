# Blood cell classification using interpretable shape features: A Comparative study of SVM models and CNN-Based approaches
This paper presents a competitive solution for blood cell classification using support vector machines with a polynomial kernel with interpretable features. This approach was able to achieve an overall classification rate of about 98% and outperformed convolutional neural network based approaches by about 10%. Furthermore, by using variables which have a clear meaning, we can create a model which is far more interpretable and competitive as its convolution neural network counterparts.
